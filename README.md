# RaspberryPI

This Repository contain the code of all the programs which i learned during RaspberryPI lectures.


### DS18B20:

1. It is digital temperature reading sensor 
2. The best thing about DS18B20 is data is transfer through one wire
3. They have unique 32-bit addressing system which allow us to connect multiple DB18S20 sensor together.
4. The RaspberryPi don't have a ADC chip. The DS18B20 sensor convert the analog signal to digtal on the way. Therefore unlike TMP36 sensor we can get digital sensor.
5. It can operate in the range of -55 C to 125 C
